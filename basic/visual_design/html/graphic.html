                By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. 
                One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need 
                to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with 
                the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

                You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly 
                offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.

                In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.

                You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes 
                values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. 
                The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
