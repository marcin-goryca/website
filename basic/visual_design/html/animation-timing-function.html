                In CSS animations, the <strong>animation-timing-function</strong> property controls how quickly an animated 
                element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from 
                <strong>point A</strong> to <strong>point B</strong> in a given time (your animation-duration), the <strong>animation-timing-function</strong>
                says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, 
                the default value is:
                <ul>
                    <li><kbd>ease</kbd>, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down 
                        again in the end.</li>
                    <li><kbd>ease-out</kbd>, which is quick in the beginning then slows down,</li>
                    <li><kbd>ease-in</kbd>, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end,</li>
                    <li><kbd>linear</kbd>, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <p>In CSS animations, <span class="underline">Bezier curves</span> are used with the <kbd>cubic-bezier</kbd> function. The shape of the 
                curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. 
                The <strong>X-axis</strong> of this coordinate system is the <span class="underline">duration of the animation</span> (think of it as a time scale), 
                and the <strong>Y-axis</strong> is the change in the animation.
                </p>

                <p>The <kbd>cubic-bezier</kbd> function consists of four main points that sit on this <strong>1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, p3</strong>. 
                p0 and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively 
                at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you 
                place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS 
                by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points in the form: <code>(x1, y1, x2, y2)</code>. 
                Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

                <p><code>animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);</code></p>
                </p>
                <p>
                In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), 
                which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). 
                This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using 
                the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <p>
                A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds 
                up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between 
                the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. 
                Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier 
                curve function.
                </p>
                <p>
                In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, 
                which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using 
                values to mimic the ease-out style:

                <p><code>animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);</code></p>
                </p>
                <p>
                Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). 
                In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, 
                then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis 
                (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element 
                progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, 
                the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), 
                and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to 
                the animation duration.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <p>The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the 
                animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle 
                of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the 
                upward and downward movement of the ball.
                </p>

                <p>
                The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

                <p>cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped 
                on a 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can 
                be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for 
                simulating the juggling ball.
