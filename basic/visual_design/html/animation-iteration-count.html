            <h1>Animation Iteration Count</h1>

            <div>
                The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

                animation-iteration-count: 3;
                
                In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.
