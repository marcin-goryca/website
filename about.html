        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article id="artAboutMe">
            Long, long time ago...I have started coding journey with HTML4. Then after a while I discovered C++. And I felt in love with it.
            That was my first programming language. I have spend some time with JavaScript, but I didn't like it as much as C++.
            For me C++ was the <b>King of programming languages</b>. Of course there was PHP (which I don't like for the time being), Java, Python and C#.
            I am still in love with C++, but I don't have enough time to code with it.
            Now I learn vanilla JavaScript and its libraries like Angular, React. My current aspiration is Front-End Development.
            Except programming, I have strong graphics talent. I work with vector graphics, raster graphics and also with 3D.
            I've studied Computer Science at WSB-NLU in Nowy Sacz.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <article id="myHobbies">
            I love guitar. And I play guitar quite a lot. Music has huge impact in my life, I can't live without it.
            My favorite genre of music is metal, but I can listen any kind of good music.
            Do I have other hobbies? Yes, I love movies (I know how it sounds, live with it, I don't care...).
            What else? Travelling, visiting new places. It gives me energy.
            I must mention Mountains. I am just in love with Mountains and hiking.
